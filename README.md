FIXME: my new library.

## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

    $ clojure -A:test:runner

Build a deployable jar of this library:

    $ clojure -A:jar

Install it locally:

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables:

    $ clojure -A:deploy
